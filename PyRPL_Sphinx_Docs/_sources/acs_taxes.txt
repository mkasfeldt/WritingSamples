acs_taxes module
============================

Purpose
----------------------------
Contains all the functions needed to create a tax year from either the data in the text extracts from the HP or from the ACS database.
This module contains all the functions to create and update the billdata.sqlite database from the data contained in the ACS database on the sql server and the HP text files. 
it connects via odbc string that is created in the Taxdata class. The sql statements that are used are contained in the text files in the sql folder. 
This was done to keep the code in the modules clean and allow nice human readable sql statements to be maintained and easily modified. 
this sub-module also imports functions from the utilities module to clean data from the ACS system and format it as needed. 
The method called to create data is the createTaxDB method. The method called to update a tax year is called updateTaxDB

Usage
----------------------------

Create all tax years to 2011::

	from PyRPL.__PyRPL import acs_taxes
	taxdata = acs_taxes.Taxdata()
	taxdata.buildHPData()
	for year in range(2011,2012)
		taxdata.buildACSData(year)
	taxdata.upatePayments(2012)
